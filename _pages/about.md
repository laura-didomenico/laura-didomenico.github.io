I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be/nl/wie-is-wie/detail/laura-didomenico), in Belgium. I am a mathematical epidemiologist with expertise in data-driven modeling of infectious disease dynamics, integrating human behavior through social contacts and mobility and accounting for population sociodemographic heterogeneity. I hold a Master Degree in Applied Mathematics and a PhD in Epidemiology and Public Health. I have been working extensively on social contact matrices and real-time modeling of COVID-19 
to assess effectiveness of control strategies and inform pandemic response.

Research interests
------
- data-driven modeling of human behavior and disease dynamics
