I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Science Institute, [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be/nl/wie-is-wie/detail/laura-didomenico), in Belgium. I am specialized in data-driven modeling of infectious disease dynamics, integrating human behavior through social contacts and mobility and accounting for population socio-economic heterogeneity. I have been working extensively on social contact matrices and real-time modeling of COVID-19 to assess effectiveness of control strategies and inform pandemic response.
